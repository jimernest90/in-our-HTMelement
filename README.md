#### The analogy of a web page would be:<br/><br/>
- HTML is like the bones<br/>
- CSS is the skin<br/> 
- Javascript is the muscles<br/>
- This means that HTML is our structure of our web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the design of our webpage. Javascript is how we make our web page dynamic. 

### What are HTML tags??
HTML consists of a series of elements. <br/>
Tags are what surround HTML elements. Most Elements have an opening and closing tags.<br/>
The opening tags looks like  &lt;tag> . The Closing tag is &lt;/tag> . <br/>
The content for the HTML element goes between the tags like this: &lt;tag> Content &lt;/tag> <br/>
&lt;h1>&lt;/h1> to &lt;h6>&lt;/h6> are title tags from biggest to smallest. <br/>
&lt;p> &lt;/p> are paragraph tags. <br/>

Some tags afe self closing. For example image tags &lt;img src='link'/>

### DocType

Every HTML document has a document type declaration. This would look something like: &lt;!Doctype html> This is not an HTML tag. This is information to the browser. 
This tells the browser what document type it's dealing with.

#### The analogy of a web page would be:<br/><br/>
HTML is like the bones<br/>
- CSS is the skin<br/> 
- Javascript is the muscles<br/><br/>
- This means that HTML is our structure of our web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the design of our webpage. Javascript is how we make our web page dynamic. 

### What are HTML tags??

HTML elements are surrounded by tags. "<p>" : paragraph element "<h1> to <h6>" : header tags corresponding to the size of the header. "<h1>" is the largest header element.
